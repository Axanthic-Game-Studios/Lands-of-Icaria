Fixes

- fix missing hatch on Forge item model
- fix missing texture on the underside of the pliers laying on the Forge
- fix tinted breaking particles emitted from several blocks e.g. Grassy Marl, Troughs, Vines and potted plants
- fix missing animal health, when an animal grows and increases its size, it also increases its max health, but not the health itself, e.g. an Aeternae when fully grown from a bred or spawned baby Aeternae would still only have one single health point instead of 16, this is fixed now

Updates

- update Aeternae to feed from Troughs filled with Spelt
- update Catoblepas to feed from Troughs filled with Spelt
- update Sow to feed from Troughs filled with Onions
- update Bubble Spell to play a sound when cast
- update Bubbles spawned from Bubble Spell to play a sound when they pop
- update Bubbles spawned from Bubble Spell to pop at different times instead of all at once
- update Kettle sound type from stone to wood since it is mostly made of wood instead of stone
- update Pillar Heads to show a tooltip, hinting their placement can be inverted while sneaking
- update spawn rates for Argan Hound and Cerver to spread out their appearance and make place for the newly added Crocotta, Argan Hounds mostly occur in Forests now and Cervers mostly occur in Scrublands now
- update Troughs to be able to be filled with Water using Water Bottles and emptied using Glass Bottles, to be filled with Mediterranean Water using Mediterranean Water Buckets and emptied using Buckets, to be filled with Onions for Sows to feed from, to be filled with Spelt for Aeternae and Catoblepas to feed from, to be filled with Vineberries for Capella to feed from
- update Icaria Chest and Trapped Chest to color text on applied Chest Labels with Dye, mark it as glowing with Glow Ink Sacs, revert the glowing with Ink Sacs and wax it with Honeycombs to prevent further editing similar to signs with simple right click actions
- update Chest Labels to no longer need to be named or renamed in an Anvil and cleared with shift right click, they open a GUI with right click now, offering an interface to set, update and reset the text of the label, this will no longer change the item name itself which still can be changed by editing it with an Anvil but will have no effect on the shown text on the label when applied to a chest – the name of the text is shown beneath the item name in a tool tip now, alongside with the color and style for glowing text, in case the label was already applied to chests and altered with Dyes and Ink Sacs – applying Chest Labels to Icaria Chests and Trapped Chests no longer needs to be done with shift right click, a simple right click action will suffice now, only removing the Chest Labels from an Icaria Chest or Trapped Chest will need the player to shift right click the label now

Additions

- add Capella, a new animal that comes in four sizes similar to our other animals, loves to eat Vineberries and drops new loot
- add the Capella Horn, a rare mob drop that will be useful for content from an upcoming update
- add Raw and Cooked Capella Meat, two new meat variants dropped from the Capella
- add the Capella Skull that can be obtained as a rare drop
- add Crocotta, a new monster that spawns in the dark during night, hunts in packs and drops new loot

- add two new paintings, Ender Jellyfish and Window
- add a recipe to craft Packed Mud with Spelt
- add a recipe to craft Crafter with Icaria crafting tables
- add subtitles for sounds, e.g. a Catoblepas uses vanilla sounds and therefore displays unfitting subtitles like "Cow moos" which is changed to the fitting subtitle "Catoblepas moos" now, also custom sounds are fitted with subtitles now, e.g. a Grinder grinding uses custom sounds but had no subtitles registered with them which is also changed now, this applies to all blocks, entities and items that have sounds tied to them
